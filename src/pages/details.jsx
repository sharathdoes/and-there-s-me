      <p>
        I'm Sharath, a web developer and Generative AI enthusiast currently studying 
        Computer Science and Business Systems (CSBS) in my third year at VNR VJIET. I worked at Stalcon Solutions as a Full-stack Intern. 
        When I’m not coding, I enjoy watching movies, which inspire my creativity and 
       bring new perspectives to life.

            It's funny how 95% of the ocean remains unexplored, yet we spend so much time 
            perfecting websites and tech. I love the sea, its endless mysteries, and how it reminds me there’s always more to learn.
